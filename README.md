# Happy-birthday

I made this for my Dad on his birthday.
I know the font is not good but this was my first project related to AR.
So it was cool.
I mean it was pretty AWESOME...

I just thought that many people might be thinking the same way,
To great their friends and family members in this pandamic.

So all you have to do is that,

Change the text in the value field on line number 19 according to you.

Then open the image named as Hiro.png in one device.

Finally open this link in another device 

https://aum-singhal.github.io/Happy-birthday/

Finally allow the camera and double tap on the screen.
And point your camera toward the image.

Wool.. Surprise.
Hope you liked it.
